## <center>Code purpose:</center>

Affects `world save file`. There are such world save file items:

- Block _(the most lightweigth. Block's mesh is **just a cube**)_;
- EntityBlock _(pistons, grass, half block, etc. Unlike `Block`s, `EntityBlock`s have custom mesh and can have **a custom hitbox** );_
- Entity_(`despawns: false`);_
